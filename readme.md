>A website that lets a community of people learn foreign languages and cultures by listing events (MeetUps - I originally had 'events' name, but it caused too much problems with conflicting Events classes in Laravel) where certain languages are spoken.
>A user can search MeetUps by language, location or name. Also they can add, edit and delete MeetUps if they see incorrect information.
>I haven't completed My Profile page, as I haven't decided what exactly should go there, perhaps the users can have an option to suggest an event for review, or leave a feedback for existing ones.

The users need to log in to go past the 'login/signup' page. The email field is already pre-filled with an existing login t@gmail.com and the password 123456 can be used to log in for the testing purposes.
I used Bootstrap for the added design and functionality features.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
